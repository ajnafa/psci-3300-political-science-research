Multiple Regression II
================

Continuing our introduction to regression, this week we’ll take a more
detailed look at the logic of regression adjustment as a means of
dealing with confounding. Moving beyond the framework of constant linear
relationships, we’ll explore more principled approaches to analyzing
non-linear relationships and questions of classification that are
distinct from regression.
