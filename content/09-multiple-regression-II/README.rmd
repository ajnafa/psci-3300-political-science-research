Continuing our introduction to regression, this week we'll take a more detailed look at the logic of regression adjustment as a means of dealing with confounding. Moving beyond the framework of constant linear relationships, we'll explore more principled approaches to analyzing non-linear relationships and questions of classification that are distinct from regression.
