Hypothesis Testing and Theory Evaluation
================

The dominant approach to evaluating theories of politics quantitatively
often takes the form of *hypothesis testing*. Despite its persistence in
the field, the most common manifestation, Null Hypothesis Significance
Testing (NHST), suffers from an number of logical inconsistencies that
are not always understood. This week we’ll look at the basic logic of
hypothesis testing in political science, the questions it can and cannot
answer, and alternative approaches that are better suited to answering
the questions social scientists are often interested in.
