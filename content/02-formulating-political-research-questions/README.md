Formulating Political Research Questions
================

The first step in the process of political research is formulating a
question. For instance, scholars of political representation have long
pondered whether the interests of privileged social groups are
disproportionately represented in policy outcomes and why such
inequalities arise. This week’s focus will be on formulating and
narrowing an empirical research question. We will also cover how to
survey existing research on a subject effectively and efficiently using
Google Scholar and other resources.
