## How Should we Study Politics? {#sec-introduction}

Political science is a field characterized by a diverse range of approaches to inquiry and debates about how we ought to study political phenomena have long animated the discipline.

::: incremental
-   **Normative**

    -   Focused on subjective, moral questions about the world and how things *ought to be*.

-   **Empirical**

    -   Focused on objective explanation and description, questions about how the world *is* and *why.*

## Normative Approaches

Normative approaches to the study of politics date back thousands of years and feature prominently in the sub-field of political philosophy.

::: incremental
-   How should the world look? Asks for a moral judgement

    -   Who should be responsible for paying for the consequences of climate change?

    -   Should we fire Elon Musk into the Sun?

    -   Should women have autonomy over their reproductive choices?

    -   Is it fair to forgive student loan debt?

-   Normative arguments are common in certain areas of law and philosophy but have no place in this course as they do not lend themselves to scientific answers
:::

## Empirical Approaches

Empirical approaches are those that aim to apply the scientific method to the study of politics and hold a dominant place contemporary political science.

::: incremental
-   Empirical approaches can be descriptive or causal, quantitative or qualitative, experimental or observational but they all aim to answer some question about *how, what, or why the world is*.

-   **Description** focuses on observing and measuring the state of the world; it aims to answer questions about *who* or *what* in relation to some phenomena [@Gerring2012].

    -   What is democracy and how can we operationalize it?

    -   Who won the 2020 presidential election election?

## Empirical Approaches

**Description** has a valuable place in political science and accurate description is essential to empirical research.

::: incremental
-   Descriptive approaches tend to lend themselves to dichotomous answers

    -   Is country $A$ more democratic than country $B$?

    -   Is American democracy in decline?

    -   Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 U.S. presidential election?

-   Yet, it is necessarily inferior to causal approaches because it cannot answer questions of *why* or *how* things happen

-   We'll take a more detailed look at the role of description in quantitative political research when we discuss measurement
:::

## Empirical Approaches

::: incremental
-   **Causal** approaches are concerned with explaining *why* some phenomenon occurs in the world [@Samii2016].

-   Contemporary political science is a discipline interested in answering *causal questions*.

    -   Why do poor conservatives tend to vote against their own economic interests?

    -   How do gender-inclusive peace processes influence the risk of conflict recurrence?

    -   How would the world change if we fired Elon Musk into the Sun?

-   Our focus in this class will be primarily on causal questions and entirely on empirical approaches to the study of politics
:::

## What is Causal Inference?

::: incremental
-   Does forgiving student loan debt increase inflation?

    -   Imagine student loan debt is forgiven and inflation increases

    -   Would this increase have happened if student loan debt had not been forgiven?

-   How do gender-inclusive peace processes influence the risk of conflict recurrence?

    -   Conflicts that terminate with gender-inclusive peace provisions tend to be less likely to recurr

    -   Would conflict have recurred in the abscence of these gender-inclusive peace provisions?

-   Causal inference is about **counterfactuals**
:::

## What is Causal Inference?

A **counterfactual** is what would have happened in the absence of some intervention.

::: incremental
-   Imagine a study of $\color{sample} n$ individuals

    -   $\color{sample} n_{\color{treat} 1}$ are assigned some treatment

    -   $\color{sample} n_{\color{untreat} 0}$ do not receive the treatment

-   For each individual $\color{index} i \color{operator}\in \{1, 2, \dots, \color{sample} n \color{operator}\}$ we observe the outcome $\color{resp}Y_{\color{index}i}$

-   Treatment status for each individual $\color{index} i$ $$\color{treatment} X_{\color{index}i} \color{operator} = \begin{cases}\color{treat} 1 \text{  if treated}\\ \color{untreat} 0 \text{  if not treated}\end{cases}$$

-   Some set of pre-treatment covariates $\color{confounders} Z_{\color{index}i}$
:::

## What is Causal Inference?

Counterfactuals are questions about the data we do not observe, not the data we do.

::: incremental
-   We want to know the causal effect of $\color{treatment} X_{\color{index} i}$ on $\color{resp} Y_{\color{index} i}$

    -   If an individual is <font style="color: #FF5B78">treated</font>, $\color{treatment} X_{\color{index} i} \color{operator} = \color{treat} 1$ and we observe some value of $\color{resp} Y_{\color{index} i}$

    -   What value of $\color{resp} Y_{\color{index} i}$ would we have observed if $\color{treatment} X_{\color{index} i} \color{operator} = \color{untreat} 0$ instead?

-   **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

    -   For each individual $\color{index} i$ we can only observe $\color{treatment}X_{\color{index} i} \color{operator} = \color{treat}1$ or $\color{treatment}X_{\color{index} i} \color{operator} = \color{untreat} 0$

    -   Causal inference is a missing data problem

-   How do we overcome this problem?

    -   We make assumptions to bridge these parallel worlds
:::

## Firing Billionaires into the Sun

Imagine we are interested in whether firing billionaires into the Sun might cause some meaningful improvement in the world.

::: incremental
-   A study of $\color{sample} n$ billionaires

-   For each billionaire $\color{index} i \color{operator}\in \{1, 2, \dots, \color{sample} n \color{operator}\}$ we observe the state of the world $\color{resp}Y_{\color{index}i}$ before and after they are assigned to either the treatment or control group

-   Treatment status for each billionaire $\color{index} i$ $$\color{treatment} X_{\color{index}i} \color{operator} = \begin{cases}\color{treat} 1 \text{  if fired into the Sun}\\ \color{untreat} 0 \text{  if not fired into the Sun}\end{cases}$$

-   Some set of pre-treatment covariates $\color{confounders} Z_{\color{index}i}$
:::

## Firing Billionaires into the Sun

::: incremental
-   The causal effect of firing a billionaire into the Sun is

    -   $\color{resp}Y_{\color{index}i}\color{treat}(\text{Fired into the Sun})\color{operator} - \color{resp}Y_{\color{index}i}\color{untreat}(\text{Not fired into the Sun})$

-   For each billionaire $\color{index} i$ we can either <font style="color: #FF5B78">fire them into the Sun</font> or <font style="color: #50BFE6">not fire them into the Sun</font>, but it is impossible do both

    -   This is the **fundamental problem of causal inference**

-   Also illustrates some practical limitations

    -   No IRB would ever approve this study and billionaires are a hard to sample population 😭

    -   [It is really, really hard to fire subjects into the Sun](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/09/20/this-is-why-we-dont-shoot-earths-garbage-into-the-sun/?sh=1af1b4115d63)

    -   More efficient to eject them out of the Solar system with a gravity assist from Jupiter instead

## What Causal Inference is Not

![](../../../../assets/dank-memes/causal-pidgeon-impact-or.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## What Causal Inference is Not

::: incremental
-   Descriptions of how the world is, correlations, joint distributions, predictions, regression coefficients, odds ratios, probabilities, etc.

    -   All of these things may be useful and some may have causal interpretations under specific circumstances

    -   They do not, however, in and of themselves capture causal relationships without additional assumptions

-   A **causal effect** is the change we would observe if we manipulated some feature of the world while holding all else constant

    -   Sometimes we do not know because we cannot know--**there is no magic**
:::

## Why Causal Inference?

As it turns out, causal inference is really, really hard so why bother at all?

::: incremental
-   We could just make some claims and use a bunch of weasel words to avoid saying "cause" and "effect" while still heavily implying causality, right?

    -   "$\color{treatment}X$ explains $\color{resp}Y$"

    -   "$\color{treatment}X$ has an impact on $\color{resp}Y$"

    -   "People who do $\color{treatment}X$ are more likely to experience $\color{resp}Y$"

-   Lots of people still do this!

    -   Makes it hard to distinguish between what is real and what is not, results in the proliferation of *pseudo-facts* [@Samii2016]

    -   Important to be explicit about our assumptions, intentions, and goals
:::

## Key Takeaways

::: incremental
-   Difference between **normative** and **empirical** approaches in political science

    -   Distinction between **descriptive questions** and **causal questions**

-   **Counterfactuals** and the **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

-   What causal inference is and what it is not

-   We will spend the rest of the semester building on this foundation
:::

## Getting Started with R and RStudio

::: incremental
-   Read the installation instructions on Canvas under the module for Week I

-   Easiest way to avoid headaches involving file paths is for you to download the [course's repository from github](https://github.com/ajnafa/psci-3300-political-science-research)

    -   Either download a zip file of the current version and extract that somewhere on your computer

    -   Or you can install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) which integrates with RStudio

        -   [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) is a free online book on getting started with git in RStudio

        -   This approach let's you pull updates from the course repo directly from RStudio

-   This will ensure your relative file paths match mine and will make it easier for me to help you
:::

## Workflow Basics

::: incremental
-   Project-Oriented Workflow

    -   Work in [RStudio projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)

        -   Helps you keep things organized in appropriate subfolders

        -   All file paths are <font style="color: #00F5FF">**relative**</font> to the .Rproj file's location

    -   Write code in scripts

        -   Helps you keep track of and structure your data, analysis, etc.

        -   Comment your code

        -   Use seperate scripts for each part of your analysis, problem sets, etc.

-   We'll talk more about [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and dynamically reproducible documents next week
:::

## Scripts in R

It is generally considered good practice to load the packages you use in a script and set any global options for the R session at the top of the script.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#---------------------R for Political Research: Lesson I-----------------------
#-Author: A. Jordan Nafa-----------------------------Created: August 19, 2022-#
#-R Version: 4.2.1-----------------------------------Revised: August 28, 2022-#

# Set Session Options, you could also declare these in a .Rprofile
options(
  digits = 4, # Significant figures output
  scipen = 999, # Disable scientific notation
  repos = getOption("repos")["CRAN"] # repo to install packages from
)

# Load Required Libraries, run install.packages("pacman") first
pacman::p_load(
  "tidyverse", # Suite of packages for tidy data management 
  "data.table", # Package for high-performance data management 
  "dtplyr", # Package to interface between dplyr and data.table
  install = FALSE # Set this to TRUE to install missing packages
)
```

Since code is executed sequentially, this ensures any dependencies required for later code chunks have already been loaded prior to their execution.
