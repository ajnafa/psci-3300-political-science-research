## How Should we Study Politics? {#sec-introduction}

Political science is a field characterized by a diverse range of approaches to inquiry and debates about how we ought to study political phenomena have long animated the discipline.

::: incremental
-   **Normative**

    -   Focused on subjective, moral questions about the world and how things *ought to be*.

-   **Empirical**

    -   Focused on objective explanation and description, questions about how the world *is* and *why.*

## Normative Approaches

Normative approaches to the study of politics date back thousands of years and feature prominently in the sub-field of political philosophy.

::: incremental
-   How should the world look? Asks for a moral judgement

    -   Who should be responsible for paying for the consequences of climate change?

    -   Should we fire Elon Musk into the Sun?

    -   Should women have autonomy over their reproductive choices?

    -   Is it fair to forgive student loan debt?

-   Normative arguments are common in certain areas of law and philosophy but have no place in this course as they do not lend themselves to scientific answers
:::

## Empirical Approaches

Empirical approaches are those that aim to apply the scientific method to the study of politics and hold a dominant place contemporary political science.

::: incremental
-   Empirical approaches can be descriptive or causal, quantitative or qualitative, experimental or observational but they all aim to answer some question about *how, what, or why the world is*.

-   **Description** focuses on observing and measuring the state of the world; it aims to answer questions about *who* or *what* in relation to some phenomena [@Gerring2012].

    -   What is democracy and how can we operationalize it?

    -   Who won the 2020 presidential election election?

## Empirical Approaches

::: incremental
-   **Causal** approaches are concerned with explaining *why* some phenomenon occurs in the world [@Samii2016].

-   Contemporary political science is a discipline interested in answering *causal questions*.

    -   Why do poor conservatives tend to vote against their own economic interests?

    -   How do gender-inclusive peace processes influence the risk of conflict recurrence?

    -   How would the world change if we fired Elon Musk into the Sun?

-   Our focus in this class will be primarily on causal questions and entirely on empirical approaches to the study of politics
:::

## What is Causal Inference?

::: incremental
-   Does forgiving student loan debt increase inflation?

    -   Imagine student loan debt is forgiven and inflation increases

    -   Would this increase have happened if student loan debt had not been forgiven?

-   How do gender-inclusive peace processes influence the risk of conflict recurrence?

    -   Conflicts that terminate with gender-inclusive peace provisions tend to be less likely to recurr

    -   Would conflict have recurred in the abscence of these gender-inclusive peace provisions?

-   Causal inference is about **counterfactuals**
:::

## What is Causal Inference?

A **counterfactual** is what would have happened in the absence of some intervention. Counterfactuals are questions about the data we do not observe, not the data we do.

::: incremental
-   Imagine a study of $\color{sample} n$ individuals

    -   $\color{treat} n_{1}$ are assigned some treatment

    -   $\color{untreat} n_{0}$ do not receive the treatment

-   For each individual $\color{index} i \color{operator}\in \{1, 2, \dots, \color{sample} n \color{operator}\}$ we observe the outcome $\color{resp}Y_{\color{index}i}$

-   Treatment status for each individual $\color{index} i$ $$\color{treatment} X_{\color{index}i} \color{operator} = \begin{cases}\color{treat} 1 \text{  if treated}\\ \color{untreat} 0 \text{  if not treated}\end{cases}$$
:::

## What is Causal Inference?

::: incremental
-   We want to know the causal effect of $X_{i}$ on $Y_{i}$

    -   If a respondent is treated, $X_{i} = 1$ and we observe some value of $Y_{i}$

    -   What value of $Y_{i}$ would we have observed if $X_{i} = 0$ instead?

-   **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference**

    -   For each individual $i$ we can only observe $X_{i} = 1$ or $X_{i} = 0$

    -   Causal inference is a missing data problem

-   How do we overcome this problem?

    -   We make assumptions to bridge these parallel worlds

    -   We will spend the rest of the semester on this
:::

## Why Causal Inference?

As it turns out, causal inference is really, really hard so why bother at all?

::: incremental
-   We could just make some claims and use a bunch of weasel words to avoid saying "cause" and "effect" while still heavily implying causality, right?

    -   "$X$ explains $Y$"

    -   "$X$ has an impact on $Y$"

    -   "People who do $X$ are more likely to experience $Y$"

-   Lots of people still do this!

    -   Makes it hard to distinguish between what is real and what is not, results in the proliferation of *pseudo-facts* [@Samii2016]

    -   Need to be explicit about our assumptions, intentions, and goals
:::

## What Causal Inference is Not

::: incremental
-   Descriptions of how the world is, correlations, joint distributions, predictions, regression coefficients, odds ratios, probabilities, etc.

    -   All of these things may be useful and some may have causal interpretations under specific circumstances

    -   They do not, however, in and of themselves capture causal relationships without additional assumptions

-   A **causal effect** is the change we would observe if we manipulated some feature of the world while holding all else constant
