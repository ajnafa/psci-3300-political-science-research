Theory Building in Political Science
================

At the most basic level, a theory is a verbal or formal explanation that
describes a causal relationship between two or more variables. That is,
a theory is our proposed answer to the question of why and how some
phenomena occurs; a data story about why we think a causal relationship
such as
![Race \longrightarrow Vote\~Choice](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;Race%20%5Clongrightarrow%20Vote~Choice "Race \longrightarrow Vote~Choice")
or
![Federalism\_{j\[t\]} \longrightarrow Conflict\_{j\[t+1\]}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;Federalism_%7Bj%5Bt%5D%7D%20%5Clongrightarrow%20Conflict_%7Bj%5Bt%2B1%5D%7D "Federalism_{j[t]} \longrightarrow Conflict_{j[t+1]}")
exists. This week we look at what makes a good theory, different ways of
verbally and formally expressing theoretical relationships, and making
explicit connections between research question, theory, and data.
