Causal Relationships in the Quantitative Social Sciences
================

In quantitative political research we are generally interested in
explaining the causes of effects. This week introduces the basic logic
of causal relationships, their formal representation through directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs), and different types of estimands that aid us in
answering our research questions and arriving at valid conclusions in
political science.
