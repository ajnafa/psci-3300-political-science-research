Foundations of Probability and Statistics for Political Research
================

While we introduced the basics of descriptive statistics in prior
classes, this week we’ll turn our attention to the application of
probability theory and statistical reasoning that provide a foundation
for the methods covered in the remainder of the course. We’ll cover
selection bias, the difference between samples and populations, and the
basic logic of statistical inference as it relates to contemporary
political science.
