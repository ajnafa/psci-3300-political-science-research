Regression models are ubiquitous in political science and serve as the primary workhorse for statistical inference. This week we will continue our introduction to the foundations of applied statistics in political science and the use of regression as an approach to estimating and describing relationships. We'll also more concretely discuss the assumptions necessary for valid inference.
