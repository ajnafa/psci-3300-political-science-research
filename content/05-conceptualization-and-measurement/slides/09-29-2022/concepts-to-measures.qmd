## Overview

::: incremental
-   Social science is about developing and evaluating causal theories

    -   Does <font style="color:#00F2FF">economic development</font> lead to <font style="color: #62FC6B">democratization</font>?

    -   Do <font style="color:#00F2FF">gender quotas</font> cause an increase in <font style="color: #62FC6B">female representation</font>?

-   Theories are comprised of linkages between **concepts**

    -   Gender Quotas, electoral institutions, women's CSOs, public opinion, and political corruption

    -   Causal relationships are comprised of concepts that influence one another

    -   Important to consider how we measure these concepts

## Concepts and Measurement

::: incremental
-   Concepts are theoretical abstractions

    -   Sometimes measurement is straightforward

        -   What is your age?

        -   What state do you live in?

    -   Other times measurement is more complicated

        -   What is political corruption?

        -   What is female representation?

        -   What is democracy?

    -   Have to develop an **operational** definition of a concept before we can measure it
:::

## Description

**Description** has a valuable place in political science and accurate description is essential to empirical research.

::: incremental
-   Descriptive research is comprised of three primary goals

    -   To answer research questions

    -   To generate research questions
    
    -   To do both of these iteratively

-   Yet, it is necessarily inferior to causal approaches because it cannot answer questions of *why* or *how* things happen
:::

## Descriptive and Causal Questions

::: incremental
-   Descriptive Question: Who Votes for Trump?

-   Causal Question: Why do people vote for Trump?

-   Descriptive Question: What is media bias?

-   Causal Question: Does media bias influence political attitudes?
:::

## Quantitative Description

::: incremental
-   A *rectangular*, observation-by-variable dataset

    - "dataset observations" (DSOs)
    
- A clear unit of analysis

    - Country-years, state-months, respondent-year, etc.
    
- Requires multiple cases/units

    - Nothing can be learned from an $\sample{n}$ of 1
    
- Quantitative and qualitative measures

    - In the social sciences quantitative variables are measures of qualitative concepts
    
- Calculation of summary statistics
:::

## Tabular Data

```{r}
# Get the data we need from the vdemdata package
vdem_df <- vdemdata::vdem %>%
  # We'll use just the year 2018 here for simplicity
  filter(country_name == "Mexico") %>%
  # Transmute a subset of the data for plotting
  transmute(
    country_name,
    year,
    corruption = v2x_corr * 10,
    # Full Lower Chamber Gender Quota Scale
    quota_scale = factor(
      v2lgqugen,
      levels = 0:4,
      labels = c(
        "No Quota",
        "Quota, No Sanctions",
        "Quota, Weak Sanctions",
        "Quota, Strong Sanctions",
        "Quota, Reserved Seats"
      )
    ),
    # Legislative Election Year
    leg_election = case_when(
      v2eltype_0 == 1 | v2eltype_0 == 1 ~ 1,
      TRUE ~ 0
    ),
    # % Female Legislators
    female_leg = v2lgfemleg, femaleleg_delta = female_leg - lag(female_leg),
  ) %>%
  #
  filter(leg_election == 1 & year >= 1979) %>% 
  group_by(quota_scale) %>%
  #
  mutate(
    elections = cumsum(leg_election), 
    elections = case_when(quota_scale == "No Quota" ~ 0, TRUE ~ elections)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(-leg_election)

## Operationalization

::: incremental
- Measure features

    - Need to consider level of measurement and how to score each case on each feature
    
    - To study concepts, we need to be able to observe those concepts and encode them as variables
    
    - Can't study things we can't measure and can't measure things we can't observe
    
        - Exception to this is latent variables that we can't observe but can try to measure
    
-  The definition of a **variable**

    - A dimension that describes an observation or the *operationalization* of a concept
    
::: 
    
## Measuring Democracy

::: incremental
-   How should we measure democracy?

    -   Requires we first define democracy

    -   One of the oldest debates in comparative politics

        -   Current gold standard is V-Dem [@Coppedge2016; @Lindberg2014], but even it is imperfect and leaves room for improvement

    -   Sometimes *the worst, except for all the others* is the best we can do

    -   As a general rule, treating complex multi-dimensional concepts as dichotomies is at best logically fallacious

    -   Need to make principled tradeoffs between **parsimony** and **precision**
:::

## Assessing Measurement Quality

::: incremental
- Conceptual Clarity

    - **Conceptual Clarity** is about knowing what we want to measure

    - Poorly defined concepts lead to poorly measured variables
    
        - Ambiguity 
        
        - Vagueness
    
-  Revise concept definition as needed

    - But revisions have to made before your analysis
:::    

## Assessing Measurement Quality

::: incremental
- Construct Validity

    - **Construct Validity** is the degree to which a variable measures a concept
    
    - Does our variable actually measure what we say it measures or some secret third thing?
    
    - Construct validity is **high** if a variable adequately measures the concept we care about

    - Construct validity is **low** if a variable is actually a measure of something else
:::


## Example: Polity and Democracy

::: incremental
- Common measure of democracy that was dominant in IR and Comparative Politics for several decades
    
- Mostly a measure of institutional constraints on the executive
    
- Are institutional constraints on the executive and democracy the same thing?
    
    - There are people who think stupid things, some of them in this department, who would argue yes
        
    - As we established earlier, these people are wrong
    
- Polity is the QWERTY keyboard of political science

    - An inferior product that became entrenched by being first to market
:::

## Why Does Measurement Matter?

::: incremental
-   The measures we use often influence the answers we get

-   As a general principle, the result of any operation performed on a precise number and garbage is some variation of garbage

    -   $\mathrm{Precise~Number} \times \mathrm{Garbage} = \mathrm{Garbage}$

    -   $\sqrt{\mathrm{Garbage}} = \mathrm{Less~Bad~Garbage}$

    -   $\mathrm{Garbage}^{2} = \mathrm{Worse~Garbage}$

    -   $\frac{1}{\sample{n}}\sum_{\obs{i}=\obs{1}}^{\sample{n}}[ \mathrm{Garbage}_{\obs{i}}] = \mathrm{Better~Garbage}$

    -   $\mathrm{Precise~Number}^{\mathrm{Garbage}} = \mathrm{Much~Worse~Garbage}$

    -   $\mathrm{E[\resp{Y} _{\obs{i}} = Garbage~|~\treat{X}_{\obs{i}}=Precise~Number}] = \mathrm{Expectation~of~Garbage}$

    -   $\resp{y} _{\obs{i}} = \alpha + \hat{\beta_{1}}\times\mathrm{Polity~IV}_{\obs{i}\tim{t}} = \mathrm{Comparative~Garbage}$
:::

## Assessing Construct Validity

::: incremental
-  Most **thick** concepts are multidimensional

-  Things look for

   -  Convergence (Convergent Validity)

   -  Discrimination (Discriminant Validity)

   -  For example, the multi-trait, multi-method matrix

## Proxies and Partial Measures

![](../../../../assets/dank-memes/proxy_variable.png){fig-align="center"}

## Why do we care?

::: incremental
-  Once we have measured *variables* for *observations*, we can conduct *analysis*!

    - And not a damn moment sooner
    
-  And once we have analysis, we can *draw inferences* and *make evidence-based claims*

    - Political science is a field interested in evaluating causal theories.
    
    - No one care what you *think* unless you back it up with empircally valid evidence
:::

## Summary

::: incremental
-  We want to make claims about concepts

-  But we only observe and can only analyse observed, measured variables

-  So our task as social scientists is to

   - Link the concepts we care about to observable phenomena
  
      - Components, indicators, variables
      
      - Draw out theoretical implications from measures
      
-  Good measurement is *theory-driven*
