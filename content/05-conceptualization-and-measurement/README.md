Conceptualization and Measurement
================

Once we’ve identified a research question and outlined a set of
theoretical relationships, we need to either find or develop ways to
measure or *operationalize* the underlying concepts. This week we’ll
consider questions of whether our measures adequately capture the
concepts we claim they do, identifying the appropriate level at which to
take measurements, and the trade-offs between parsimony and precision.
