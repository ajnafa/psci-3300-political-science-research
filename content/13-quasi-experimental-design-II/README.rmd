The approaches to estimating causal effects we've examined thus far rest upon the assumption of *strict exogeniety* which tends to fail spectacularly in the context of observational data and inhibits our ability to make causal claims outside of experimental settings. This week we turn our focus to recent developments in political science that draw on a set of weaker identifying assumptions known as *sequential ignorability* to identify treatment effects and examine causal mechanisms.
