Experimental Designs and Baseline Randomization
================

The recognition that baseline random assignment of the treatment is the
only way to achieve an unbiased estimate of a causal effect was perhaps
one of the most important developments in twentieth century statistics.
Although randomized controlled trials (RCT) are often held up as the
gold standard for research design, they are not without limitations.
This week we’ll explore the basic logic of experimental design in the
context of both traditional and natural experiments, ways random
assignment can go wrong, and the trade-off between internal and external
validity.
