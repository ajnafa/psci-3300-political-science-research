This github repository is home to the content for my Fall 2022 political
science research methods and causal inference course at the University
of North Texas. The class is taught from a primarily Bayesian
perspective using R, [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), and
[`{brms}`](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and focuses heavily on
reproducibility and application rather than math for for math’s sake.
This repository will be updated throughout the course of the Fall 2022
semester with lecture materials, tutorials for R, and R scripts to
reproduce each of the articles listed on the course syllabus. To
download the current version of the course content, you can execute the
following command from a desktop terminal

    git clone https://github.com/ajnafa/psci-3300-political-science-research.git

Due to copyright limitations, PDF versions of the assigned readings for
the course are not provided via github but are available upon request as
is course content tailored to the Canvas LME (i.e., html pages for each
week).
